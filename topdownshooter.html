											<p>This is the fourth game prototype I have made for my rapid games prototyping module at #university. This time I made a Top-Down Shooter in #unity by developing scripts and assets that could be put together into a framework to show my development within this module.
												<br>
												This is the first #prototype I have felt comfortable creating using unity 2d with my knowledge gained from the course. I prioritized getting the game mechanics to work properly as I hope to work within the programming side of things and struggle making art for games and decided that a simple approach for assets I create would ensure that I achieved the desired outcome I had for this project. Although the most of the sprites are simple squares I hope that it gets across my intended goal with this prototype although improvements are still needed.
												<br>
												I created a movement script for both the player and the enemies and made a wave spawning system that could use some work. The enemies move at a constant rate towards the tower and created a drop rate system for items that could be picked up to heal from defeating enemies. The tower moves in the movement path of a circle and shoots depending on the turrets angle.
												<br>
												This video attached showcases the game so far although I intend to further develop this game using the knowledge I gained while making this prototype and hopefully developing it into a final product someday.</p>
