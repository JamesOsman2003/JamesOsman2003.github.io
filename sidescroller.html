											<p>I created a Side Scrolling Shooter 2D Game within 24 hours. This is for my #university course and was meant to be the second #prototype we were meant to work on for our Rapid Games Prototyping Module.
												I created this using #unity from a framework given however I decided to not use the scripts which we were provided with and instead created all of the code behind the game from scratch. I enjoy working on #AI, so within this prototype you can face a butterfly which moves in a sin wave towards one side of the screen and if it reaches the other side before the player defeats the enemy it will get the location of the player and dash towards it until it reaches the side it started on. I created a boss battle towards at the end by stopping the background from scrolling and making an AI which will move up and down , while periodically spawning enemies to attack the player.</p>
