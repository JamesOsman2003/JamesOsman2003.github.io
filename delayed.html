											<p>I created this Game using Unreal Engine 4 for my final project last year. It was a lot of fun as we got to work in teams alongside an advisor from, Make Your Escape Derby, who helped us to come up with the concept and ensure it was what the company was looking for.
												<br>We were luckily able to showcase this alongside other escape games created by our class at the Derby Quad. I had a great time seeing all the games we had made being showcased together and being able to play them all.
												<br>The Aim was to create a quick online experience for people to be able to try out an escape room and hopefully encourage people to go to an escape room.
												I found making the post processing material for the outlines of objects very challenging and would like to further develop my skills in with these materials. I hope to attempt a similar project sometime in the future allowing me to test further develop my skills within unreal and as a programmer.</p>
